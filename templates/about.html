    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770.
            While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in
            the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
            Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground
            as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
            company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly
            Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of
            Thorin's companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.

            Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of
            Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring,
            and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a
            book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his
            heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
